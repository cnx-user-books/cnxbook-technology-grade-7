      <title>ELECTRICAL SAFETY</title>
      <para id="id2393541">Much of the equipment used in class requires electrical power from either batteries or the mains. Remember that moisture and water conduct electricity. Care should be taken when handling electronic components, such as capacitors. Batteries are best kept in separate containers when not in use. Return them at the end of the lesson. Do not put projects away with batteries in place or connected. Do not be tempted to tinker with mains electricity. If you come into contact with a live wire an electric shock or fatal accident could be the result. Electric shocks can cause severe burns and other injuries, so always take care.</para>
