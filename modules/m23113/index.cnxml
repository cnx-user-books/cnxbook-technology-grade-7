      <para id="id1164018823089">Today, different types of machines are used to cause motion. In the past, people and animals generated the power that was needed to move their vehicles or implements. They had to draw wagons, ploughs and sleds, thus moving the implements by sheer muscle power. Later people learned to harness natural forces such as wind and running water. Nowadays most machines are driven by electricity. A machine has an electrical motor that creates the power for an object to move.</para>
