      <title>MAKING A GARMENT</title>
      <para id="id3408378">Before you can make a garment, you need to have a pattern. Patterns simply are sheets of paper or cardboard. Each pattern piece is shaped precisely and serves as a master copy according to which you cut the different parts of the garment out of fabric. It is possible to buy a different pattern for each garment or to use a basic pattern, like dressmakers, and adjust it according to need. But before you can cut out a pattern, you need to know what your measurements are.</para>

      <para id="id1172775343394">Try on the old shirt to see whether it still fits you properly. If the fit is slightly tight or loose, you must bear this in mind so that you can make adjustments to the width at the seams.</para>
      <para id="id8489074">Step 2:</para>
      <para id="id3911999">Carefully unpick the seams of the old shirt. Place the different parts on a large sheet of newspaper and trace the outlines carefully, using a pencil. At this stage you must ensure that the shirt will fit properly. If necessary, you must use a tape measure and adjust the measurements of different parts to do so. If you should like to change the style, it must also be done at this point. You might decide to change the round neckline to a V-neckline, to have long sleeves instead of short sleeves, or to cut the shirt shorter, and so on.</para>
      <para id="id6830324">Step 3:</para>
      <para id="id8373932">Cut out the different pattern pieces and pin them together, using straight pins. Fit the pattern loosely around you to see how you are managing. Check whether you have made proper allowance for all the seams and hems. Is the length correct? Are the sleeves long enough? Check all aspects of the pattern. Then indicate the notches that will ensure that you fit the different pattern pieces together correctly.</para>
      <para id="id1172775025036">Step 4:</para>
      <para id="id1172773447858">You may now remove the pins and lay out the pattern pieces neatly on unprinted paper before tracing the final pattern. Cut out these pattern pieces.</para>

      <para id="id1172772629257">Study the different pieces of a bought pattern to find out as much as you can about the information that is given on the different pattern pieces. Try to transfer the most important information to your own pattern pieces, e.g.:</para>

        <item>How many of each pattern piece you need to cut out (you will have one pattern piece for a sleeve, because the sleeves will be the same).</item>

        <item>he direction in which the pattern pieces should be laid on the fabric.</item>
